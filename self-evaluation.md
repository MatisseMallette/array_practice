- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

  I think I thoroughly understand the fundamentals of arrays, as well as how the functions pop, push, shift, unshift and take work.

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

  I don't think there is anything I need to immediately go out of my way to study. I trust that all I will need to know will be taught to me as I continue the program.

- What questions do you have about Arrays?

  Why is the word array capitalized when we refer to them outside of code? Is that a convention?

- Commit your work.

  What am I supposed to answer here? 'Commit your work'. That isn't a question... Unless I'm missing something. Is this a trick question?
